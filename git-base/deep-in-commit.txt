Deep in commit

It is not a big deal to understand "commit" which is an operation such as take photo, record something.

Git will not track all the files under the repo, rather you should use "add" operation to let Git know that what files is you wanna Git to track.

When you let Git tracking those files, and then those can be committed or can be back to the not tracked state of the start.

Why Git is designed to first add second commit?

Because not everything in the repo that you wanna record.
To make a tracked area to store part of files will save many computer resources.

Something in the tracked area will show that "will be committed".

A usual workflow is we add many files in the tracked area and run a concetrated commit operation later.

At last, you should check if the commit have a real effect, just use log to see what happened.
